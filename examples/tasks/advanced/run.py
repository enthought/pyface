"""
Simple example of an advanced task application creating tasks and panes from
traits components. Compared to the basic example, this version creates a real
TaskApplication to manage the GUI part. Additionally, the code editor uses a
tab viewer to support opening multiple files at once.

Note: Run it with
$ ETS_TOOLKIT='qt4' python run.py
as the wx backend is not supported yet for the TaskWindow.
