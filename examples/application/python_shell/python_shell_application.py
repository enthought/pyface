"""
Example GUI Application
=======================

This is an example of a Pyface GUI application.  The key bulk of the work is
done by the create_python_shell_window function which creates a
PythonShellWindow instance and overrides the window's menu bar to add
additional application-level menu items.

This also shows how to provide branding for window icons, splash-screen images
and about dialogs.
