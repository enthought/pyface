    Usage
    -----
    ::

        # Common usage calling a `function` that will open a dialog and then
        # accept the dialog info.
        tester = ModalDialogTester(function)
        tester.open_and_run(when_opened=lambda x: x.close(accept=True))
        self.assertEqual(tester.result, <expected>)

        # Even if the dialog was not opened upon calling `function`,
        # `result` is assigned and the test may not fail.
        # To test if the dialog was once opened:
        self.assertTrue(tester.dialog_was_opened)

    .. note::

       - Proper operation assumes that at all times the dialog is a modal
         window.
       - Errors and failures during the when_opened call do not register with
         the unittest testcases because they take place on a deferred call in
         the event loop. It is advised that the `capture_error` context
         manager is used from the GuiTestAssistant when necessary.
