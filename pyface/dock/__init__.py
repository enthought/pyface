""" Pyface 'DockWindow' support.

    This package provides a Pyface 'dockable' window component that allows
    child windows to be reorganized within the DockWindow using drag and drop.
    The component also allows multiple sub-windows to occupy the same
    sub-region of the DockWindow, in which case each sub-window appears as a
    separate notebook-like tab within the region.
