""" Provides an AbstractDataModel ABC for Pyface data models.

This module provides an ABC for all data view data models.  This specifies
the API that the data view widgets expect, and which the underlying
data is adapted to by the concrete implementations.  Data models are intended
to be toolkit-independent, and be able to adapt any approximately tabular or
nested data structure to what the data view system expects.

class AbstractDataModel(ABCHasStrictTraits):
    """ Abstract base class for Pyface data models.

    The data model API is intended to provide a common API for hierarchical
    and tabular data.  This class is concerned with the structure, type and
    values provided by the data, but not with how the data is presented.

    Row and column indices are represented by sequences (usually lists) of
    integers, specifying the index at each level of the hierarchy.  The root
    row and column are represented by empty lists.

    Subclasses need to implement the ``get_column_count``,
    ``can_have_children`` and ``get_row_count`` methods to return the number
    of columns in a particular row, as well as the hierarchical structure of
    the rows.  Appropriate observers should be set up on the underlaying data
    so that the ``structure_changed`` event is fired when the values returned
    by these methods would change.

    Subclasses also have to implement the ``get_value`` and ``get_value_type``
    methods.  These expect a row and column index, with root values treated
    specially: the root row corresponds to the values which will be displayed
    in the column headers of the view, and the root column corresponds to the
    values which will be displayed in the row headers of the view.
    The ``get_value`` returns an arbitrary Python object corresponding to the
    cell being viewed, and the ``get_value_type`` should return an instance of
    an ``AbstractValueType`` that adapts the raw value to the data channels
    that the data view expects (eg. text, color, icons, editable value, etc.).
    Implementations should ensure that the ``values_changed`` event fires
    whenever the data, or the way the data is presented, is updated.

    If the data is to be editable then the subclass should override the
    ``set_value`` method.  It should attempt to change the underlying data as a
    side-effect or raise DataViewSetError on failure (for example,
    setting an invalid value).  If the underlying data structure cannot be
    listened to internally (such as a numpy array or Pandas data frame),
    ``set_value`` should also fire the ``values_changed`` event with
    appropriate values.

    In the cases where the underlying data structure cannot be observed by
    the usual traits mechanisms, the end-user of the code may be responsible
    for ensuring that the ``structure_changed`` and ``values_changed`` events
    are fired appropriately.
