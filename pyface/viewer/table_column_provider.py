    By default an item has no icon, and 'str' is used to generate its label.

    # This class currently does not specialize the base class in any way.
    # It is here to (hopefully) make the APIs for the viewer, content and label
    # provider classes more consistent.  In particular, if you are building a
    # table viewer you sub-class 'TableContentProvider' and
    # 'TableLabelProvider'.  For a tree viewer you sub-class
    # 'TreeContentProvider' and 'TreeLabelProvider'  instead of some
    # combination of the specific and generic viewer classes as in JFace.
