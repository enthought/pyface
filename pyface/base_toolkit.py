""" Common toolkit loading utilities and classes

This module provides common code for ETS packages that need to do GUI toolkit
discovery and loading.  The common patterns that ETS has settled on are that
where different GUI toolkits require alternative implementations of features
the toolkit is expected to provide a callable object which takes a relative
module path and an object name, separated by a colon and return the toolkit's
implementation of that object (usually this is a class, but it could be
anything).  The assumption is that this is implemented by objects in
sub-modules of the toolkit, but plugin authors are free to use whatever methods
they like.

Which toolkit to use is specified via the :py:mod:`traits.etsconfig.etsconfig`
package, but if this is not explicitly set by an application at startup or via
environment variables, there needs to be a way of discovering and loading any
available working toolkit implementations.  The default mechanism is via the
now-standard :py:mod:`importlib_metadata` and :py:mod:`setuptools`
"entry point" system.

This module provides three things:

- a function :py:func:`import_toolkit` that attempts to find and load a toolkit
  entry point for a specified toolkit name

- a function :py:func:`find_toolkit` that attempts to find a toolkit entry
  point that works

- a class :py:class:`Toolkit` class that implements the standard logic for
  finding toolkit objects.

These are done in a library-agnostic way so that the same tools can be used
not just for different pyface backends, but also for TraitsUI and ETS
libraries where we need to switch between different GUI toolkit
implementations.

Note that there is no requirement for new toolkit implementations to use this
:py:class:`Toolkit` implementation, but they should be compatible with it.

Default toolkit loading logic
-----------------------------

The :py:func:`find_toolkit` function uses the following logic when attempting
to load toolkits:

- if ETSConfig.toolkit is set, try to load a plugin with a matching name.
  If it succeeds, we are good, and if it fails then we error out.

- after that, we try every 'pyface.toolkit' plugin we can find.  If one
  succeeds, we consider ourselves good, and set the ETSConfig.toolkit
  appropriately.  The order is configurable, and by default will try to load
  the `qt4` toolkit first, `wx` next, then all others in arbitrary order,
  and `null` last.

- finally, if all else fails, we try to load the null toolkit.
