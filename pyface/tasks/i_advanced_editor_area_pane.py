        Because editors do not have IDs, they are identified by their index in

        editor.

        The layout should have panes with IDs as described in ``get_layout()``.
        For example, if one wanted to open two editors side by side, with the
        first to the left of the right, something like this would appropriate::

            editor_area.edit(File('foo.py'))
            editor_area.edit(File('bar.py'))

        Editors that are not included in the layout will be tabbified with other
        editors in an undefined manner.

        If the layout is None, this method is a no-op. Hence it is always safe
        to call this method with the results of ``get_layout()``.
