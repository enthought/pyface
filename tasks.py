"""
Invoke Tasks for Test Runs
==========================

This file is intended to be used with `Invoke http://www.pyinvoke.org/`_ to
automate the process of setting up test environments and running the test
within them.  This improves repeatability and reliability of tests be removing
many of the variables around the developer's particular Python environment.
Test environment setup and package management is performed using
`EDM http://docs.enthought.com/edm/`_

To use this to run you tests, you will need to install EDM and Invoke into
your working environment.  You will also need to have git installed to access
required source code from github repositories.  You can then do::

    invoke install --runtime=... --toolkit=...

to create a test environment from the current codebase and::

    invoke test --runtime=... --toolkit=...

to run tests in that environment.  You can remove the environment with::

    invoke cleanup --runtime=... --toolkit=...

If you make changes you will either need to remove and re-install the
environment or manually update the environment using ``edm``, as
the install performs a ``python setup.py install`` rather than a ``develop``,
so changes in your code will not be automatically mirrored in the test
environment.  You can update with a command like::

    edm run --environment ... -- python setup.py install

You can run all three tasks at once with::

    invoke test_clean --runtime=... --toolkit=...

which will create, install, run tests, and then clean-up the environment.  And
you can run tests in all supported runtimes and toolkits (with cleanup)
using::

    invoke test_all

Currently supported runtime values are ``2.7`` and ``3.5``, and currently
supported toolkits are ``null``, ``pyqt``, ``pyside`` and ``wx``.  Not all
combinations of toolkits and runtimes will work, but the tasks will fail with
a clear error if that is the case.

Tests can still be run via the usual means in other environments if that suits
a developer's purpose.

Changing This File
------------------

To change the packages installed during a test run, change the dependencies
variable below.  To install a package from github, or one which is not yet
available via EDM, add it to the `ci-src-requirements.txt` file (these will be
installed by `pip`).

Other changes to commands should be a straightforward change to the listed
commands for each task. See the EDM documentation for more information about
how to run commands within an EDM enviornment.
